# Figma Plugin: Vue (Typescript, Vite)

A Figma plugin boilerplate,
that simplifies building Figma or FigJam plugins
with Vue + Typescript + Vite.

Borrowing from https://github.com/CoconutGoodie/figma-plugin-react-vite
Specifically following their repo structure and using their monorepo networker:
https://github.com/CoconutGoodie/monorepo-networker

This repo also includes some [additional helpers for interacting with
the Figma API](./src/common/figma/README.md).

I also include `figma-plugin-ds` as a dependency for default styling: https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds
